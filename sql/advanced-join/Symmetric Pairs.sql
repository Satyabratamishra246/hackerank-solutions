-- You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
-- Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
-- Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

SELECT f1.x,f1.y
FROM Functions f1
JOIN Functions f2
ON f1.x=f2.y AND f1.y=f2.x
GROUP BY f1.x,f1.y
HAVING
    COUNT(f1.x) > 1 OR f1.x < f1.y
